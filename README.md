# Giphy-API-Project
Testing out the Giphy API and AJAX

This project is intended to test out the Giphy API, and get requests using AJAX. Add a new button category by entering in the field and submitting. Press the buttons to append 15 gifs onto the site. These gifs start out still, but you can press it again to make it move as a real gif.
